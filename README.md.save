Document Object Model (DOM)
1. Character
2. Tokens
3. Nodes
4. Dom

1. The special characters indicate a relationship that represent tokens(2)

2. Tokens are being consumed and being convereted to node(3) objects
DOCTYPE
start tag
end tag
comment
character
end-of-file

3. This list of tokens then goes through the tree construction stage. The 
output of this stage is a tree-like structure - this is the DOM! 

4. Object Model of the Document!

----------------------------------
NODES, ELEMENTS AND INTERFACE

An interface is like a blueprint, properties are like bits of information or data, and methods are functionality.

innerHTML property of an element will return html string and can be rewritten using html (unlike innerText which takes html literal) 

IMPORTANT
innerText v. textContent (probably want to use textContent)
1. innerText will return text as displayed or not displayed using css show
2. textContent will return text as written in code


.createElement()
.createTextNode()
.appendChild()
.insertAdjacentHTML()


Add new page content

.insertAdjacentHTML() method has to be called with two arguments:

the location of the HTML
the HTML text that is going to be inserted

<!-- beforebegin -->
<p>
  <!-- afterbegin -->
  foo
  <!-- beforeend -->
</p>
<!-- afterend -->
