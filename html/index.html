  <h1>Hello Ramon</h1>
  <p>good morning ...</p>
  <p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
  <p>Can we have Bender Burgers again? And then the battle's not so bad? With gusto. Kif might!</p>
  <p>Also Zoidberg. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. <strong> How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</strong> <em> OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</em> You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
  <p>Why would I want to know that? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery
    can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
  <p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if
    Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</li>
    <li>File not found.</li>
    <li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Say what? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there,
    and you were there, and you were there!</p>
  <p>A sexy mistake. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't
    wanna be right.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why would I want to know that?</li>
    <li>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</li>
    <li>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It doesn't look so shiny to me. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p>
  <p>Noooooo! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed
    in.</p>
  <p>Professor, make a woman out of me. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
  <p>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. We're also Santa Claus! Tell them I hate them.</p>
  <p>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! It must be wonderful. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. You don't know how to do any of those. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?</p>
  <p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. You're going to do his laundry? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food,
    food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
  <p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. No, just a regular mistake. Yeah, lots of people did. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
  <p>Who am I making this out to? A true inspiration for the children. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I love you, buddy! Kif might!</p>
  <p>Your best is an idiot! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the
    Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
  <p>I just told you! You've killed me! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
  <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Is today's hectic lifestyle making
    you tense and impatient?</p>
